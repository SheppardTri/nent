  <h1>Partial Content</h1>
  <p class="lead"> Optimize your HTML app,
    by leveraging lazy-loading and only pulling
    in heavy dependencies when you absolutely
    need them.
  </p>

  <h2>Include Remote HTML</h2>
  <p>To make big applications manageable, developers adhere to a
    strict 'do not repeat yourself' principle. If the same HTML is exists
    in more than one place, you'll want to manage it in a singe place.</p>
  <p>It makes updates much easier, and you can leverage its lazy-loading feature
    to make the site render faster.</p>
  <p>Organize these fragments however you like, then inject them
    into your application, using the <a href="/components/x-content">
      <b>&lt;x-content&gt;</b>
    </a> component.
  </p>

  <h3>Example Include:</h3>
  <p>Just specify the source location and the element does everything else.
    If the file is not on the same server as the master page, you may have
    to configure CORS. You can read more about that in the element docs.
  </p>
  <p>If the fragment has script or css-dependencies
    use the
    <a href="/components/x-content-reference">
      <b>&lt;x-content-reference&gt;</b>
    </a> element to ensure the dependencies are loaded. Read more about
    this below.
  </p>
  <x-content-markdown>
    <script type="text/markdown">
      ```html
      <x-content src="/widgets/calendar.html"> </x-content>
      ```
    </script>
  </x-content-markdown>

  <h2>Guarantee Dependency References</h2>

  <p> Once you start breaking your site up into fragments, you'll find it
    improves performance to not pull in any remote scripts or style-sheets until
    you need them. Using the

    <a href="/components/x-content-reference">
      <b>&lt;x-content-reference&gt;</b>
    </a> component, you decorate fragments with the remote dependencies that
    HTML needs, and the element will make sure it's there. If the user already
    went to a page-title with that component, it won't be added again. Keep your
    HTML light and functional.
  </p>

  <h3>Example Reference</h3>
  <x-content-markdown>
    <script type="text/markdown">
      ```html
      <x-content-reference
        script-src="https://cdn.google.com/apis/calender.js"
      >
      </x-content-reference>
      <google-calendar></google-calendar>
      ```
    </script>
  </x-content-markdown>
