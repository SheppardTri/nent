## What is Nent?

Nent is a library of function-elements (web-components) that add new features aimed for developing web applications.

> 'Nent' comes from the word compo-*nent* and it is the uncreative result of my tech-brain doing 'branding'.  

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to empower the next generation of web developers to create web-experiences with less development and deployment friction, within a single semantic-system. (Really though, I just needed to make high-performing, lightweight, web-applications quickly -- without complex builds, or frameworks.)

## Declared Functionality

Each elements encapsulate a feature or functionality, like routing, dynamic templates, and reusable-partials.

Simple web applications could be completely declarative, using HTML semantics. 

Declarative System Advantages:

* Easier to understand and reason about
* Easier to maintain, with reduced side-effects
* Deterministic, and testable with static-analysis 
* More accessible / approachable to a wider range of humans. 

### System Groups

The elements are named and grouped by their system or sub-system, with shared services enabled with a root-tag. 

Sub-systems add functionality to other systems. For instance, view routes can use data-expressions in their content when the data-system is included.

### Views: `<n-views-*>`
This is the routing and navigation system
- Single Page Application Routing
- Fast navigation between views
- Page History
- Route Transitions
- Nested Layouts
- Nav Links with Active Route detection
- Navigation Lists:
  Nav Bars, Child Menus and Breadcrumbs
- Guided Navigation
- View-Timed Actions
- View Entry / Exit Actions
  
### Content: `<n-content-*>`
- Dynamic Content Rendering
- Deferred Content
- Markdown Rendering
- Remote HTML

### App: `<n-app-*>`
- Page/Document Management
- Theme Detection & Control
- Console Logging
- UI Component Kit Integrations
- PWA Support (coming)

### Actions: `<n-action-*>`
- Declared Actions
- Reactive Activators
- Exposes the Event / Action Bus to the DOM
- Async Functions

### Data: `<n-data-*>`
- Adds: Expression Evaluation to conditionally rendered content
- Adds: Data-Template Rendering to `Content`
- Adds: Data-driven Rule Evaluation to `route-prompt`

### Elements: `<n-elements>`
- DOM Element Manipulation

### Audio:
- Reactive Audio
- Voice-overs
- Background Music

### Analytics:
- Page Views
- Page TImes 
- Custom Events

### Video:
- Interactive Video
- Video-Timed Actions

## Learn More

The best way to see what these elements in actoin, is to take a look at the documentation demo. The installable app is built using these elements in a single HTML file (with child-routes and partials lazy-loaded, as-needed).

## Contributions

### Built on the shoulders of giants!

Thank you to the Ionic team and their fabulous [**Stencil.js** SDK](https://stenciljs.com) for the best way to build lightening fast, native elements.

Also, thank you to the creators and contributors to all open-source efforts, but especially to the libraries we love and use in our plugin components:

- **expr-eval**: [declarative expression parser](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval) 
- **jsonata**: [declarative data query/filter/transformation](https://jsonata.org/) 
- **howler**: [easy-to-use audio playback tools](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) 
- **remarkable**: [ridiculously fast markdown processing.](https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/)
