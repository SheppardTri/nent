## What is NENT?

NENT is a library of function-elements (web-components) that add new features aimed at developing web applications.

> 'Nent' comes from the word compo-*nent* and it is the uncreative result of my tech-brain doing 'branding'.  

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to empower the next generation of web developers to create web experiences with less development and deployment friction, within a single semantic-system. (Really though, I just needed to make high-performing, lightweight, web-applications quickly -- without complex builds or frameworks.)

## Declared Functionality

Each element encapsulates a feature or functionality, like routing, dynamic templates, and reusable-partials.

Simple web applications could be completely declarative, using HTML semantics. 

Declarative System Advantages:

* Easier to understand and reason about
* Easier to maintain, with reduced side-effects
* Deterministic, and testable with static-analysis 
* More accessible/approachable to a wider range of humans. 

### System Groups

The elements are named and grouped by their system or sub-system, with shared services enabled with a root-tag. 

Sub-systems add functionality to other systems. For instance, view routes can use data-expressions in their content when the data-system is included.

### Views: `<n-views-*>`
Independent routing and navigation system.

- Single Page Application Routing
- Fast navigation between views
- Page History
- Route Transitions
- Nested Layouts
- Nav Links with Active Route detection
- Nav Lists: \
  Nav-Bars, Child Menus, and Breadcrumbs
- Guided Navigation
  
### Content: `<n-content-*>`
Independent elements for features around content HTML.
- Content Templates
- Deferred Content
- Content Data Injection
- Markdown Rendering
- Remote HTML / Partials

### App: `<n-app-*>`
Independent elements related to the file as an application.
- App Console Logging
- App Theme Detection & Control
- UI Component Kit Integrations (Ionic, shoelace, Material, etc)
- PWA Support (coming)
- Expose Event/Actions to the DOM

### Actions: `<n-action-*>`
Data structure elements to declare functions and their activations. 
- Declared Actions
- Reactive Activators
- Add Custom Async Functions

### Data: `<n-data-*>`
Optional enhancements elements to add data-functionality and data-providers.
- Expression Evaluation
- Token Resolution
- Conditional Rule Evaluation

### Elements: `<n-elements>`
An optional element that creates an action listener to handle requests for light DOM updates

### Audio: `<n-audio-*>`
Optional audio elements to display a player and create an action listener for audio commands. The player orchestrates audio playback in an opinionated format, with best practices. 
- Voice-over Audio
- Event Sounds
- Background Music

### Analytics: `<n-analytics>`
An optional element that creates an action listener that delegates analytics-specific events and route-changes to a script-configurable element for integration.
- Page Views
- View Times 
- Custom Events

### Video: `<n-video-*>`
Optional wrapper element to normalize video-events between various video players to enable media-timed events for synchronized actions. Useful for automatically navigating when a video ends or updating the content based on the video time.

## Installation

> This is a pre-release project and is subject to breaking-changes and incomplete features. Thank you for trying it out!

yarn add @nent/core
```
## Learn More

The best way to see what these elements in action, is to take a look at the documentation demo. The install-able app is built using these elements in a single HTML file (with child-routes and partials lazy-loaded, as-needed).

## Contributions

### Built on the shoulders of giants!

Thank you to the Ionic team and their fabulous [**Stencil.js** SDK](https://stenciljs.com) for the best way to build lightning-fast, native elements.

Also, thank you to the creators and contributors to all open-source efforts, but especially to the libraries we love and use in our plugin components:

- **expr-eval**: n-data [declarative expression parser](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval) 
- **jsonata**: n-content-repeat [declarative data query/filter/transformation](https://jsonata.org/) 
- **howler**: n-audio [easy-to-use audio playback tools](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) 
- **remarkable**: n-content-markdown [ridiculously fast markdown processing.](https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/)
