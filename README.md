These elements encapsulate application functionality using HTML. This approach keeps the semantics of a web application declarative and mono-linguistic.

> The goal of this project is to empower the next generation of personalized, interactive web-experiences with less friction and less semantic-diversion.

## Application Functionality, Expressed in HTML

Declarative applications are more deterministic and easier to understand for more levels of expertise. These components are segmented into option sub-systems to only require what you need:

### Actions: `<x-action-*>`

- Declared Reactive Actions
- Async Functions

### Routing: `<x-app-*>`

- URL/Hash-based Routing (within a single page!)
- Fast, SPA-like navigation between pages
- Guided navigation, wizards & workflows

### Navigation: `<x-app-*>`

- Guided Navigation
- Media-Timed Actions
- Interactive Video
- Reactive Audio

### Data: `<x-data-*>`

- Expression Evaluation & Binding
- Data-Template Rendering
- Data-driven Rule Evaluation for Navigation

### Content: `<x-content-*>`

- Dynamic Content Rendering
- Deferred Content
- Markdown Rendering
- Remote HTML

### UI: `<x-ui>`

- Interface Management
- Theme Management
- UI Component Integrations

### Elements: `<x-elements>`

- HTML Manipulation w/ Declared Actions
- "JQuery as an Async Tag"

## Installation

Add a single script-reference tag into your HTML page's head so the browser can figure out how to interpret our elements -- and that's it.

### Learn More

The best way to see what these elements can do for your HTML is to take a look at the documentation/demo. The site is built using these elements as a single HTML file with partials pulled in, as-needed.

## Contributions

### Built on the shoulders of giants!

Thank you to the Ionic team and their fabulous [**Stencil.js** SDK](https://stenciljs.com) for the best way to build lightening fast, native elements.

Also, thank you to the creators and contributors to all open-source efforts, but especially to the libraries we love and use in our plugin components:

#### Data `<x-data>`

- **SilentMatt**: [expression evaluator](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval) for a declarative expression parser
- **JSONata**: [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) another declarative approach for solving problems, this uses expressions to query JSON.

#### Audio `<x-audio>`

- **howler.js**: [howler-js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) best audio library for managing audio files

#### Markdown `<x-content-markdown>`

- **remarkable**: [remarkable](https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/) Ridiculously fast markdown to HTML processing.
